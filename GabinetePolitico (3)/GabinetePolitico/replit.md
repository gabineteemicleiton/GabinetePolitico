## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## Technical Notes

**Incomplete Implementation**: The repository contains only partial files (HTML head/header, incomplete JavaScript, and CSS variables). The full functionality for form handling, content management, and complete sections would need to be implemented.

**Future Enhancements**: The current static approach could be extended with:
- Backend API for form submissions
- Content management system
- Database integration for dynamic content
- User authentication for administrative features

**Accessibility Considerations**: The current structure shows good semantic HTML practices and includes proper ARIA labels through Font Awesome icons.
